## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 2 - Keep Note Assignment
### Assignment Step Description
In this case study: Keep Note Step 2, we will create an Application which accepts Note Title, Note Content, and Note Status as input from the front end and displays the same along with the LocalDateTime of posting in a reverse chronological order (latest Note first). 

Even though functionality-wise and the output of step-1 and step-2 are same, 
 1. In step-1 we created a monolithic application but in this step-2, we will use proper annotations like @Repository, @Autowired etc.,  
 2. In this step-2, we should not use "new"  keyword to create an instance.  
 3. Hibernate was not added in Step-1 but in Step-2 we will use Hibernate.

Here we will have a **Note** class which will be acting as the data model for note table in the database. Please note that this class is annotated with **@Entity annotation** (**The @Entity annotation marks the class as an entity bean, so it must have a no-argument constructor that is visible with an at least protected scope**), 
where Hibernate will scan all the packages for any Java objects annotated with the @Entity annotation. 
If it finds any, then it will begin the process of looking through that particular Java object to recreate it as a table in your database. 

### Problem Statement
In this case study: Keep Note Step 2 we will create an application that requires us to implement four functionalities. They are as follows:
1. Display the list of existing notes from the database.
2. Add a new Note.
3. Delete Note
4. Update/ Modify Note.

    
    Note: For detailed clarity on the class files, kindly go thru the Project Structure

### Expected solution

A form containing three text fields (Note Title, Note Content, Note status) and Add button, below to this will be a tabular column with the fields Note Title,  Note Content, Note status and LocalDateTime(This will be published in reverse chronological order). 
When the user enters the Note Title, Note Content, Note status and clicks on Add button, it gets stored in the database and later renders in the tabular column.

### Following are the broad tasks:
1. Create the application-context for the application. 
2. Extend AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer class WebApplicationInitializer.
3. Create WebMvcConfig which implements WebMvcConfigurer.
3. CRUD (Notes)
4. Implement the NoteDAO interface and annotate with @Repository annotation in NoteDAOImpl.

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder in your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Add relevant dependencies in pom.xml file. 
        Note: Read the comments mentioned in pom.xml file for identifying the relevant dependencies.
    Step 3: In ApplicationContextConfig.java add the required annotations, as well as add base packages to scan in @componentScan Annotation. Define the bean for DataSource, SessionFactory and Transaction Manager.
    Step 4: In WebMvcConfig.java add the required annotations. Define the bean for ViewResolver
    Step 4: Specify Root config and ServletConfig class in WebApplicationInitializer.java file.
    Step 5: In Note.java file (which is considered as Model class), annotate this class with @Entity Annotation and add a @Id annotation to specify the primary key for the table.
    Step 6: Read all the methods mentioned in the NoteDAO interface.
    Step 7: Provide the implementation for all the methods of NoteDAO interface in NoteDAOImpl. These classes have to be annotated with @Repository and @Transactional.
    Step 8: Run the test cases for NoteDAOImpl.java class (NoteDAOImplTest.java)
    Step 9: Annotate the NoteController.java class with @Controller annotation, and define handler methods.
    Step 10: Run the testcases for NoteController.java (NoteControllerTest.java)
    Step 11: Design a form.
    Step 12: Run the application on a configured web server.

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step2** of your local machine
    
    `git clone https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_java_keep/KeepNote-Step2-Boilerplate.git`
    
2. Navigate to the assignment-solution-step2 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step2`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step2` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step2.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
